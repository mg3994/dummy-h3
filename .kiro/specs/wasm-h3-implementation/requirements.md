# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a WebAssembly-compatible H3 (HTTP/3) library that can run in WASI environments. The project aims to provide a lightweight, efficient HTTP/3 client and server implementation that leverages QUIC transport protocol while being compatible with WebAssembly runtime constraints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a WebAssembly application developer, I want to use HTTP/3 for network communication, so that I can benefit from improved performance, multiplexing, and connection migration features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WebAssembly application imports the H3 library THEN the library SHALL be compatible with WASI runtime environments
2. WHEN the library is compiled for WASM target THEN it SHALL produce optimized WebAssembly bytecode under 2MB
3. WHEN the library is used in a WASM environment THEN it SHALL NOT require native system calls outside of WASI specification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish HTTP/3 connections, so that I can send and receive HTTP requests over QUIC transport.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing an H3 connection THEN the system SHALL support QUIC connection establishment with TLS 1.3
2. WHEN a connection is established THEN the system SHALL support HTTP/3 frame parsing and generation
3. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN the system SHALL support request/response multiplexing over a single QUIC connection
4. WHEN connection errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide proper error handling and connection recovery

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to send HTTP/3 requests, so that I can communicate with HTTP/3 servers efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL support GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH methods
2. WHEN sending requests THEN the system SHALL support custom headers and request bodies
3. WHEN receiving responses THEN the system SHALL parse HTTP/3 response frames correctly
4. WHEN handling responses THEN the system SHALL support streaming response bodies
5. WHEN requests timeout THEN the system SHALL provide configurable timeout handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a server application, I want to handle incoming HTTP/3 requests, so that I can serve content over HTTP/3 protocol.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving HTTP/3 requests THEN the system SHALL parse request headers and bodies correctly
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL support routing based on path and method
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL create valid HTTP/3 response frames
4. WHEN serving content THEN the system SHALL support streaming response bodies
5. WHEN handling multiple clients THEN the system SHALL support concurrent connection handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that I can build robust applications with proper error recovery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information
2. WHEN protocol errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle QUIC and H3 protocol violations gracefully
3. WHEN connection issues arise THEN the system SHALL support automatic retry mechanisms
4. WHEN errors are encountered THEN the system SHALL log appropriate diagnostic information
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL fail safely without crashing the WASM runtime

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious developer, I want efficient resource usage, so that my WebAssembly application performs well with limited resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL minimize memory allocations and deallocations
2. WHEN handling connections THEN the system SHALL reuse connection pools efficiently
3. WHEN parsing frames THEN the system SHALL use zero-copy parsing where possible
4. WHEN managing buffers THEN the system SHALL implement efficient buffer management
5. WHEN running in WASM THEN the system SHALL have minimal impact on application startup time

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple and intuitive API, so that I can easily integrate HTTP/3 functionality into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the client API THEN it SHALL provide async/await compatible interfaces
2. WHEN configuring connections THEN it SHALL support builder pattern for configuration
3. WHEN handling responses THEN it SHALL provide convenient response parsing utilities
4. WHEN debugging THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive logging and tracing capabilities
5. WHEN integrating THEN it SHALL be compatible with popular Rust async runtimes in WASM
